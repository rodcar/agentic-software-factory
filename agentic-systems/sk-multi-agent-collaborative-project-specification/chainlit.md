# Collaborative Project Specification System

## Welcome to the Collaborative Project Specification System!

This system uses a team of AI agents to help you define and refine software project specifications:

1. **Project Definition Agent**: Creates a comprehensive functional specification based on your idea
2. **Test Planning Agent**: Develops a testing strategy and detailed test cases
3. **Reviewer Agent**: Reviews both documents for quality and suggests improvements

## How to use:

1. Start by sharing your project idea in as much detail as possible
2. The agents will collaborate to create your project specification and test plan
3. Review the outputs and request revisions as needed
4. Approve the final documents when you're satisfied

Your approved specifications will provide a solid foundation for implementation and can be used with Azure DevOps or other project management tools.
